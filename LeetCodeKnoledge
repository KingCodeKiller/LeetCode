LIFO Stack myStack = new Stack();

FIFO Queue<String> myQueue = new LinkedList<String>();

linkedlist.get() can't use for compare, should use .equal();

difference .equals vs ==
.equals: is for object value
==     : is for type compares object identity
and == can't use for String compare and .equals can't use for char compare
